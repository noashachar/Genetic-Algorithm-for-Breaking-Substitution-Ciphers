# Genetic Algorithm for Breaking Substitution Ciphers

Please read `report.pdf` (Hebrew).


## How to Run

### Option 1:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noashachar/Genetic-Algorithm-for-Breaking-Substitution-Ciphers
cd Genetic-Algorithm-for-Breaking-Substitution-Ciphers
python3 part_a.py
```
* The flag `--minimal-prints` can be passed.
* If you don't have NumPy installed, please run `python3 -m pip install NumPy`. 

### Option 2:
If you're on Windows, you can download the folder and **double-click `part_a.exe`**. <br/>
Make sure `freq-triplets.json` is in the same folder next to the code!

## output
The following files will be created by part_a:
1. **perm.txt** (substitution table).
2. **plaint.txt** (the deciphered text).
