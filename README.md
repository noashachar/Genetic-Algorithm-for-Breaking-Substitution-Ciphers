# Genetic Algorithm for Breaking Substitution Ciphers

Please read `report.pdf`.


## how to run

Make sure `freq-triplets.json` exists in the same folder next to the code!

### Option 1:
```
  python3 part_a.py
```
* The flag `--minimal-prints` can be passed.
* If you don't have numpy installed, please run `python3 -m pip install numpy`. <br/>
*the "planet" linux servers at BIU already have numpy installed.*

### Option 2:
If you're on windows, **double click `part_a.exe`**.

## output
The following files will be created by part_a:
1. **perm.txt** (subsitution table).
2. **plaint.txt** (the deciphered text).
